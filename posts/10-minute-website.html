  <h2>Creating your own basic .com website in 10 minutes</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://godaddy.com" target="_blank">godaddy.com</a> and register a domain for however many years you want.  I'd recommend enabling Whois protection.</li>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">wordpress.com</a> and make a free website, like "mysite.wordpress.com".</li>
    <li>In GoDaddy, set up permanent forwarding from "mysite.com" (or whatever the domain is that you paid for) to "mysite.wordpress.com", with domain masking, by following this <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/forward-a-domain-12123" target="_blank">tutorial</a> (you can do this in under 2 minutes).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Optional: upgrade your WordPress to premium so it removes the "Blog at WordPress.com." stuff at the bottom of your page.</p>

  <p>After waiting 2 minutes-2 days, you'll be able to go to mysite.com and get instantly redirected to mysite.wordpress.com.  When you edit your site via WordPress, mysite.com will get updated too, almost instantly.</p>
