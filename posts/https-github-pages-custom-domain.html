	<h1>HTTPS on Github Pages custom domains</h1>

	<p>
		Inability to use HTTPS on a custom domain hosted by Github Pages has been an <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156" target="_blank">issue</a> for <em>years</em> with no resolution in sight.  Today, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://solrevdev.com/2017/08/31/http-ssl-via-github-pages-with-flyio.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> about <a href="https://fly.io" target="_blank">fly.io</a> and it blew my mind.  I thought, "What a sparse tutorial!  It can't be <em>that</em> easy."
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, it is.
	</p>
	<p>
		Setting up HTTPS for my custom domain for my Github Page took 5 minutes and $0.  See <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156#issuecomment-338503308" target="_blank">my comment on the Github Issue</a> for how it works.  Happy encrypting!
